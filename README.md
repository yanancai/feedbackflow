# FeedbackFlow

## Overview

FeedbackFlow is a set of tools designed to collect and consolidate feedback from GitHub issues, discussions, and YouTube comments into a machine-readable format (JSON). With dedicated components for different platforms, FeedbackFlow simplifies the process of centralizing feedback for analysis and decision-making.

## Components

### GitHub Feedback Collector (`ghdump`)

This tool retrieves data from GitHub issues and discussions, including associated comments. The collected information is saved as JSON files, enabling easy integration with other tools.

### YouTube Comment Collector (`ytdump`)

This tool gathers comments from specified YouTube videos or playlists and exports them into JSON format. Input sources can be configured through a file or directly via command-line arguments.

### Podcast Idea Extractor (`podideas`)

A Python CLI toolkit with two tools:
- **`ytdump.py`** — Python port of the .NET `ytdump`, dumps YouTube comments to JSON.
- **`podideas.py`** — Analyzes comments with Azure OpenAI (`gpt-5-chat`) to identify suggested podcast topics, with incremental caching.

See [`podideas/README.md`](podideas/README.md) for details.
